<div class ="page">
    <p class="textbox">Task 3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency.
        <br><br>
            When making my website I could have been more efficient if I had asked more questions and taken more notes from the lessons in order to be able to correctly and more efficiently use the tools provided.
            <br>If I had other team members or people who were doing similar work we could have bounced ideas off of each other and helped each other in our learning and work to be more efficient.
            <br><br>
            Task 3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency.
            <br><br>
            In order to be more efficient in my projects I will need to make more notes on the processes that will be required and ask others with more experience when I am stuck on a certain issue and unable to solve it by my self.
            <br>For creative parts it would be more efficient to try to bounce ideas off other people such as themes and layouts to help myself get a better image of how I want projects to look.
            <br><br>
            Task 3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects.
            <br><br>
            A good way to make improvements on my next project would be to have some remade examples I have done of coding such as flex so that I know what I can use and how it will effect my current coding and the project.
            <br>Another way is having teammates who could split the work such as one person doing research on one subject while another researches another subject and using Slack to communicate those findings and updates between us.
            <br><br>
            Task 3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions.
            <br><br>
            The way I could test these solutions is by having another project to make a different website and trying to do the work between me and some teammates to see if this will make the work faster and more efficient as well as try preparing some ready made examples of coding I have made in my own words to better understand how the code will effect my current code and the project.</p>
