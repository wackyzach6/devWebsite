<div class ="page">
    <p class="textbox">Task 1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page 

            For my website I kept the layout the same throughout to keep it simple and avoid confusion, there is a header at the top of the page naming the contents of that page such as “outcome1” or Assignment 2” as well as a text box containing all the written details for that page, I then had buttons to the right side at the top with links to the other pages of the website, I had anime scenery for the background of the buttons as well as the background of the web pages as they made for a calm, beautiful and alluring look to the website.

            Task 1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites
            <br><br>
            Task 1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them
            <br><br>
            Some issues that may arise for easy accessibility are that some people using the site may be unable to read or see well so the website will need any images that contain text to have an alternative text as part of the image so that when people have a software that can read the webpage it will detect the text in the image so users will know what is on the website.
            <br>Another issue is that any audio would need subtitles in the video or within the webpage for any users with problems hearing so that they know what is being said on the website.
            <br>Another Issue is that some people will need a larger font to read the text on the webpage
            <br><br>
            Task 1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites
            <br><br>
            The common appropriate file type for webpages are HTML or the webpage, CSS for some of the organising of the webpage, PNG, JPG and JPEG for some images, GIF for any GIF’s, MP4 for videos and MP3 for audio files as these are the most commonly used file types.
