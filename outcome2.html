        <div class ="page">
        <p class="textbox">Task2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed â€“ in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? 
            <br><br>
                Visual Studio Code has allowed me to have all my coding in one place and to update using Git and Github to store my files in a cloud in case of being unable to access them from the local computer.
                <br><br>
                Trello has allowed me to keep my ideas and the steps of my plans organised in one place which meant that my tasks were easy to identify whether they were currently under way, needed starting or had been finished.
                <br><br>
                Codepen was very useful in being able to test out my flexboxes as I was not very confident in my use of them but in Codepen I was able to practise them until I was able to get the flex box working the way I wanted for my website by showing the changes as I made them.
                <br><br>
                Task 2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate
                <br><br>
                The tools of Visual Studio Code, Codepen and Trello were appropriate for this task as Visual code was used for the use of HTML and CSS to make the website and move the contents around and create a visually pleasing website, Codepen was useful in being able to test out my coding in real time as I changed the code to see how it would look before implementing the code into my website and Trello was appropriate as it allowed for me to keep all my plans and actions in one organised place to keep my website on the right track and tidy.
                <br><br>
                Task 2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project 
                <br><br>
                Though I am happy with the website as is with my current skill level I would still like to make some improvements if I were to improve my skills.
                <br>Some of the improvements would be to have the background image to stay the same whether the website is scrolled down where the content of the website is too large for the image of the background and also being able to have my own personalised art instead of art made for other purposes.
                <br><br>
                Task 2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project
                <br><br>
                Some improvements I would like to do as above is have a consistent background with scrolling the website and custom art, as well as these I would like to have some video examples of previous works I have done to show my skills level when I have reached higher levels of competence in coding.
                <br><br>
                Task 2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose 
                <br><br>
                I have made my website meet the requirements of the project by making buttons that link to the other pages for the website that work through having a hyperlink attached to the text.
                <br>I have used anime backgrounds for the buttons linking to the other pages because it stuck to the anime style I had chosen by having a scenery in anime style for the background of the website.
                <br>Some issues that I had come across was having difficulty getting my buttons to stay in one location regardless of if their was an increase in content on the webpage such as extra text on one page compared to another outing the buttons further down, I was able to solve this using Flexbox for the content of the page and for the buttons, another issue was that the buttons were getting pushed around by the size of the text in the image so to correct that some images had to have padding put around them to try to keep them in line with each other.</p>
