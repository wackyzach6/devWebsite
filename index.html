    <p class="textboxAbout">My Name is Zach Alderton
            <br><br>
            I am a newly training software coder who has recently started a coding course with Code 	Nation.
            <br><br>
            The Reason for me starting this course is to allow my self to learn a subject with which I have a passion for and is used in the daily lives of millions and millions of people.
            <br><br>
            I have training in business studies and AAT so I will have some background knowledge of business side details for my projects which will mean that it will be easier to explain some of the business needs for projects.</p>
