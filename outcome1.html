        <p class="textbox">Task 1.1 describe purpose of IT in modern business

            <br>  <br>  
            Time saving - A lot of tasks are automated, sped up or cleaner with the use of IT such as the use of online forms for applications being sent in to a company rather than by post which requires a lot of manual work to sort and process the many applicants .
                <br><br>
                Wider reach of communication - With IT businesses are able to contact a large amount of people through emails or through online forms or chat services on their websites.
                <br><br>
                Increasing skills - Some technology such as Virtual Reality[1] has helped surgeons by live-streaming operations with 360 degree perspectives so people around the world could watch and learn how the procedure is performed, this is more efficient than the normal way as instead of just a few trainees watching the operation thousands can watch and learn.

                <br><br>
                Task1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully
                <br><br>
                HTML - This is used to build a website, it is the structure of the website.<br>
                CSS - This is the look of the website such as background colours and the layout of the website.<br>
                JavaScript - This is the actions that are taken in the background such as when you click on a menu to show a drop down list of options.<br>
                Trello - The use of Trello has allowed me to keep all my thoughts, plans and current status of the project in one organised place so that the project was able to run more efficiently.<br>
                Github - Using Github allows me to save my code to the cloud so in case I am unable to access my local computer or wish to acces the code from another computer I can still access the code and edit it from another computer and save it to Github to access from the usual computer.<br>
                Slack - Slack has allowed me to communicate with others regarding the project and ideas for what we could do within the project which we would write on Trello.
                <br><br>
                The above tools can be used in making a website work but it is also the planning and effort put into the work that makes a project really successful, such as planning skills, attention to detail, communication skills (if working with others), time allocation and others.
                <br><br>
                1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT â€“ e.g. making your website
                <br><br>
                In order to be efficient in my planning I will be using Trello, a planning website to list out my tasks under the categories of: to do - for tasks that have yet to be started, doing - for tasks that are currently being worked on and Done - for tasks that have been finished.
                This will allow me to breakdown the tasks of the project and keep it organised and allow for better planning of the project, <a href=https://trello.com/b/Yv2q6gMa/coding-course>click here</a> to see my Trello board.
                <br><br>
                1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects
                <br><br>
                As with any task there is always risks that will be a detriment to the projects success, some of these risks will be known to us that we will know how to deal with, some will be known but that we do not know how to deal with them, some will be unknown but through planning we can be ready to deal with these issues that pop up.
                <br><br>
                Some common issues can be an update to a software being used that makes the current work already done incompatible with the updated software, a breakdown of communication, unexpected costs being incurred, work not being completed within time scales set.
                <br><br>
                1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software
                <br><br>
                When starting a new project it is important to decide the very basics of what is needed to be done so that the appropriate tools are used such as how it will look, what kinds of functionality it will have and whether the costs of those tools or methods will be financially or time wise viable as some tools will have a high cost but be very effective and some the reverse.
                <br>Another thing to consider is what equipment is right for the project for example I would be more comfortable and more efficient using a windows operating software as I use Windows in my day to day life and have used it for most of my life but for this project I have used a Mac Laptop which I am not well versed in so was slower and less efficient in my use of it for the project.
                <br><br>
                1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes
                <br><br>
                With the use of Trello I have been able to keep track of all my tasks that needed completing and update their status as needed so that my lists of tasks needing completion was tidy and up to date.
                <br><br>
                The use of Git and Github has allowed me to keep up to date saves of my work readily accessible and past versions for testing when new coding was put in place so if any incompatibility was found I could go back to the previous saves and determine where the issue had arisen.
                <br><br>
                1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects
                <br><br>
                Companies Act 2006 requires you to disclose your company details on your website such as address, name, contact email, it Does not need to be on every page but somewhere easy to find such as the about us page.[2]
                <br><br>
                GDPR is a new law that came into place in May 2018 which gives individuals more rights to protect their data and understand how data about them is handled by companies such as when opting in to additional services.
                <br><br>
                Some examples of how GDPR effects digitals projects are- 
                Emails for deals and other information, the form is defaulted to no or is blank and people have to manually opt in to the service
                Individuals can opt out of the company having their data and have to dispose of the data they store
                Companies can only store what data is absolutely necessary and only for however long the data is necessary for its intended purpose and then disposed of.
